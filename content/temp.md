Almost equivalent, but there are a few key differences:

1. Interface:
- First version uses `std::vector<uint8_t>` for both input and output of deserialization
- Second version uses `std::span<const std::uint8_t>` for deserialization, which is more flexible as it can work with any contiguous memory range

2. Implementation:
- First version uses `std::memcpy` for copying data
- Second version uses direct reinterpret casts, which could potentially cause alignment issues
- Second version has helper functions in a `detail` namespace making it more modular

3. Memory allocation:
- First version allocates memory incrementally with multiple `insert` calls
- Second version has a more structured approach with separate serialize/deserialize helpers

Both should produce the same binary format and are compatible with each other, but the second version is more modern (using `std::span`, `string_view`) and better structured. However, its use of direct reinterpret casts might be less safe than the `memcpy` approach in the first version.
